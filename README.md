The employee recruitment process takes a long time and costs a lot of money. Just the price of finding the right person to hire can be hefty. There are various potentially high costs just in the process of recruiting, according to business consultant Bill Bliss, president of Bliss & Associates Inc. These include advertising the opening, the time cost of an internal recruiter, the time cost of a recruiter's assistant in reviewing resumes and performing other recruitment-related tasks, the time cost of the person conducting the interviews, drug screens and background checks, and various pre-employment assessment tests.
Not every new hire will require the same process, but even an $8/hour employee can end up costing a company around $3,500 in turnover costs, both direct and indirect. source : https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/16562-cost-of-hiring-an-employee.html

With this high time and cost, of course it would be very unfortunate if employees who had been hired and trained suddenly decided to leave early in the job. The costs and time that have been spent will certainly be in vain
To minimize this, the HR team asked the data scientist team at the company to develop a machine learning model that can predict which employees will tend to leave the company based on employee history data so far. So it is hoped that with this machine learning model, companies can minimize recruiting employees who have the potential to leave later.

The following is an example of a simple machine learning model for the HR Department that was created using 3 types of algorithms, namely Logistic regression, random forest classification, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In this dataset, a little EDA is also carried out, what factors usually cause employees to tend to leave in the middle of their working period.

This model can still be further developed by using several engineering features such as handling imbalance, scaler, and adjusting the hyperparameters tuning.
